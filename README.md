# Score Visualization

## About

A "Score Visualization" is a simple widget needing only the name, and the BMI score of the animal which is between 0 and 120, and will nicely visualize the BMI score according to this calculation:
- if the BMI score less than 30 it will be underweight and the yellow color represents it with an indicator showing the percentage on the bar.

- if the BMI score is between 30 and 90 it will be normal and the green color represents it with an indicator showing the percentage on the bar.
  
- if the BMI score is bigger than 90 it will be overweight and the orange color represents it with an indicator showing the percentage on the bar.
